                Hi! My name is <em>Ido Talbi</em>, and currently I am a student in University of Haifa, studying Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time I enjoy contributing in 
                    <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/users/655052/talbi">Mathematics SE</a>,
                and also <a href="https://github.com/talbii"> some programming </a>. <em>Side note: </em> I despise OOP.
            </p>
            <p> Also a SWERC 2021-2022 contender. </p>
            <p>
                I am interested in countless branches of Mathematics, such as Calculus and Number Theory, 
                    and also some Computer Science stuff, like Computational Models and Algorithms. I am a pure mathematician by heart, but pursuing a different path currently. 
            </p>

            <p class="bottom">
                In my blog, which I hope to update frequently, you will find articles in which I talk 
                    about stuff that I find interesting - I hope you will too!
