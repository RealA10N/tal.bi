The many, many ways superscript is used

<!--more-->

Welcome to the game of *guess the notation*! Today, we have the following contenders:

- $f^{-1}$
- $f^n$
- $f^{(n)}$

(for $n\in\mathbb{N}$). Well, can you *guess the notation*?

Probably not. Out of the many abuses of notation in Mathematics I think that superscript is defiantly the one of the biggest (if not the biggest) abused notations. Just for fun, here are two completely different answers for the list above:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th> $f^{-1}$ </th>
        <td> Inverse of $f$ </td>
        <td> $\frac{1}{f}$ </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th> $f^n$ </th>
        <td> $n$th derivative of $f$ </td>
        <td> $f$ to the power of $n$ </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th> $f^{(n)}$ </th>
        <td> $f$ to the power of $n$ (because parenthesis don't matter) </td>
        <td> <i>Now</i> it is the $n$th derivative! (because the parenthesis matter!!) </td>
    </tr>
</table>

It seems very funny, to me, that this is just an accepted thing. Many high-school students struggle especially with the first one, and with trigonometric functions and their inverse $\sin x$ vs. $\arcsin x$ ("$\sin^{-1} x$"). *But worry do not!* for there are many more examples of abuse similar to this, regarding the superscript:

- When declaring an point of dimension $n$: $M(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$, declaring another point gets a bit funny: $M'(x_1 ^0, x_2 ^0, \ldots, x_n ^0)$ (no, this isn't a point consisting of only $1$s :)
- Thankfully, only the trigonometric functions suffer the issue with ${}^{-1}$. The expression $\ln^{-1} x$ is very clear.
- Derivatives are intuitive: When you raise the derivative (operator) to a power $n$ --- $\partial^n$, it means that you are taking it $n$ times! ...and not raising the *derivative* to $n$, obviously.
- Set theory, which is the best theory, agrees that the superscript should be reserved to mean *power of*, so $A^n$ means $A \times A \times \underbrace{\ldots}_{n-3 \text{ times}} \times A$, and so $A^B$ means... ugh.
- Another Set theory one: while I (and many more, I hope) use $\mathcal P$ to denote a *Power set*, I've seen some use $2^A$ to denote a Power set, which I believe is the worst notation, ever (what is a scalar raised to a set??)

*a never ending list.* Last updated: November 26th, 2021.
